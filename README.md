we have successfully completed our project “Electricity-Bill Management System”. This project is developed to nurture the needs of a user in a public sector by embedding all the tasks of bills.
It was a great opportunity for us to learn multiple skills like time management, delegating tasks depending on the individual's strength and it helped us to learn to work as a team to achieve our end target within the deadline.
